## Hi IÂ´m Marco ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Godot Engine for prototypes and game collabs.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
    - C# basic and for networking.
    - C++ for game and app programming.
    - Python for networking and games.
    - JS and HTML.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on games. Mostly Godot, Raylib and Pygame.

- ðŸ“« How to reach me: [Send Email](mailto:50000tons@gmail.com)

-âš¡ Fun fact: I don't usually add music or sound FX to my games or apps, even though I'm a music producer.
